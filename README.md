# Runalysis
  - A web application for analyzing GPS activities.

This application aims to provide insight and deep analysis for recorded activities such as running or cycling. I have chosen this as my programming graduation project.

You can find the application [here](https://kulisak12.github.io/Runalysis/).

## Planned functionality
  - Graphs showing elevation, pace, heart rate and other recorded data
  - Zoom-in and selection for investigating sections of the activity
  - Lap splits
  - Analysis of time spent in pace and heart rate zones
  - Training impulse

## Possible future updates
  - Map of the activity
  - Strava synchronization
